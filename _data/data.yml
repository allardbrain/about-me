    title: Here's what I'd add to your engineering team
    summary: |
      I'm an experienced Python developer with well-practiced skills in both written and verbal technical communication.
      I'm a huge fan of being kind to one's future self so I'm the person on your team who is constantly asking,
      "Did you add that to the docs?" I'm also a teammate who leads with emotional intelligence and empathy -- always.
      I love figuring out how all the parts of a system fit together, and how systems then interact with each other.

      details: |
        After 6 years of non-stop work as a software engineer — two of which
        occurred during a global pandemic – I decided to take a much-needed break and re-focus my career goals.
        I've decided that for my next job, I want to return to writing code most of the day. For the past couple of years, I've created technical content and
        provided engineering support, and I really miss being on an engineering team. During my break, I've been renovating my house, planting a giant flower garden, and
        slowly putting together a furniture-making shop in my garage.
